\section{Gates} \label{sec:gates}

Each gate is a row with 135 columns. As different custom gate has different complexity, for some complex gate 135 columns may only constraints one
operation while for other simple gate 135 columns may constraints several operations. The index of operation in a row is called slot.

Steps to use a custom gate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the type of gate;
    \item Find row and slot using gate type;
    \item Wire the operation parameters to cells found;
\end{itemize}

For the convenience of description, the trace tables in this paper only show one operation which is slot is 0.
